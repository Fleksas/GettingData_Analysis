This document provides more information about the orginal data set, its variables and all the transofrmations performed to get a new tidy data set.

## Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

For each record it is provided:

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
* Its activity label.  
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

## Data Set Files

* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
 
## Transformations

All transformations performed to get a new tidy data set are the following:

<ol>
<li>Train and test data were merge together to create a single dataset</li>
<li>Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted from that dataset</li>
<li>Descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set were used (WALKING, SITTING etc.) </li>
<li>Data set lebels were created to describe its variables ("subject","activity" etc.)  </li>
<li>A new independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created  </li>
</ol>
