# Getting and Cleaning Data Coursework

## Introduction

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which is made available on
the course web site:

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ">Human Activity Recognition</a> [60Mb]
* <b>Description</b>: Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
* Its activity label.  
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
