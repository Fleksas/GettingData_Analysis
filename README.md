This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which is made available on
the course web site:
